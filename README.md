# project-Zombiebop
2D shooter prototype made in unity
This is just a coding practice, but maybe with enough features I could launch it as a small indie game.

The version uploaded is just a test version where I coded the base for the overall gameplay, ofcourse more details will be added in newer versions.
Art is trash btw, and a huge obstacule for doing this kind of practices.
